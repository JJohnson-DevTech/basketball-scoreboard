# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a simple basketball scoreboard application built as part of the Scrimba mini project. The app keeps track of the scores for both the home and guest teams, displays the current quarter, and includes a timer for the game. 

## Features

- **Timer**: A timer that counts down from 12 minutes for each quarter. The timer can be started and stopped using the Start/Stop button.
- **Quarters**: The game is divided into 4 quarters. The quarter will reset to 12 minutes at the start of each new quarter, and when Quarter 4 ends, the message "Final" is displayed at the bottom of the scoreboard.
- **Score Buttons**: Buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points to the home and guest team's scores.
- **Reset Buttons**: Reset buttons to set each team's score back to 0 and a reset button to set the game back to quarter 1 and timer to 12:00 minutes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
